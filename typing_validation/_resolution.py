"""
Reading the component types that some forms record in annotations rather than
in ``__args__``: :class:`~typing.TypedDict` fields and
:class:`~typing.NamedTuple` fields.

Under PEP 649 an annotation is evaluated lazily, and a name that was not yet
defined survives as a :class:`~annotationlib.ForwardRef` rather than resolving.
Resolving those is this module's job.

:func:`~typing.get_type_hints` does it too, and is rejected for one decisive
reason: it is all-or-nothing. A single unresolvable field raises
:class:`NameError` for the whole class, and that error escapes from inside
:func:`~typing_validation.validate` as neither a validation failure nor an
:class:`~typing_validation.UnsupportedTypeError` — just a stray exception from a
library the caller did not know was evaluating anything. Resolving field by
field turns that opaque crash into a precise report, and lets the unresolvable
field poison only the type that contains it.

inheritance and ``total=False``. ``ReadOnly`` constrains assignment rather than

    References that resolve are replaced by what they name; references that do
    not are left in place as :class:`~annotationlib.ForwardRef` objects, for the
    caller to report against. No :class:`NameError` escapes.

    ``owner`` is not optional, and is not a convenience. A reference nested
    inside an annotation — the ``'Later'`` in ``list["Later"]`` — records no
    module of its own, and neither does *any* reference in a
    :class:`~typing.NamedTuple` field, even a top-level one. Only a top-level
    :class:`~typing.TypedDict` annotation happens to record one. So the module
    is recovered from the owning class in every case, which is both uniform and
    the only thing that works.

    This is what separates a resolvable reference from an unresolvable one: not
    whether the reference carries a module, but whether we know the class whose
    annotation it came from. An inline ``validate(x, list["JSON"])`` has no
    owner, and that — rather than the shape of the reference — is why it cannot
